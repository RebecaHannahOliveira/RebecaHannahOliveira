# Hi, I am Rebeca!

I am Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University with experience at the intersection of **computational systems biology**, **medical imaging**, and **machine learning**. My work focuses on modeling **vascular signaling pathways**, analyzing **cerebral hemodynamics**, and building **predictive models of brain blood flow dynamics** from high-resolution time-series imaging data.
